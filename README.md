Project Description: In this project, I successfully launched an Amazon EC2 instance and created an IAM role with full access to Amazon S3. This role was attached to the EC2 instance to enable seamless interaction with S3 buckets. Additionally, I configured a security group for the EC2 instance to allow SSH and HTTPS traffic, ensuring secure remote access and enabling the website to run smoothly in a browser.
